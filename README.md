# Types of Websites

- Multi page static websites
  - All files are "static" files
    - There is no server side runtime or processing
    - A request is made for a file
    - All files are loaded into the web browser
      - HTML is parsed and rendered
      - CSS is parsed and applied
      - JS is parsed and executed
  - Static File Servers

- Server Side Rendered Website (Dynamic Server)
  - How This Works
    1. A request is made to the server
    1. The server runs code to handle the request
    1. The server responds with generated HTML
    1. The server can respond with static files as well...
    - That is not the main use of this kind of server
